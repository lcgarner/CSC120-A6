- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    Building is like a parent class to the Cafe, House, and Library classes because these classes inherit the common traits of a Building while also having their own specific functionalities. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Inheritance can be a little confusing at first, more syntactically than conceptually, but playing around with it helped. Creating instances of each class and testing them within main() was necessary for me while developing my code, and I would recommend for anyone taking this course in the future to do the same.
